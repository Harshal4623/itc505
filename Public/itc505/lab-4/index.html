          How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am
          heart-burned an hour after.

        <dt>Hero</dt>

        <dd>
          He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between
          him and Benedick: the one is too like an image and says nothing, and
          the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.

          Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half

        <dd>
          With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his
          purse, such a man would win any woman in the world.

    <!-- ARTICLE 2: ADDENDUM -->
    <article class="card addendum">
      <h2>Addendum</h2>

      <p>
        For Lab 4, I focused on making this page comfortable to read on a laptop.
        Since it’s a text-heavy scene, I tried to make the layout feel like a clean
        printed page: centered content, clear headings, and plenty of breathing room.
      </p>

      <h3>Font choices</h3>
      <p>
        I used a classic serif font for the main text because it matches the “play script”
        feeling and stays readable for long passages. For headings, I kept the same family
        so the page feels consistent instead of mixing too many styles.
      </p>

      <h3>Heading sizes and main text size</h3>
      <p>
        The main text is set to a comfortable size for reading and the line height is increased
        so paragraphs don’t feel cramped. The <code>h1</code> is noticeably larger to clearly show the
        title, while <code>h2</code> and <code>h3</code> are smaller but still distinct so the addendum is easy to scan.
      </p>

      <h3>Color choices</h3>
      <p>
        I chose a soft background (not pure white) to reduce eye strain. The text is a dark gray
        instead of pure black to feel gentler. I used one accent color for borders and speaker labels
        to add structure without making the page look “loud.”
      </p>

      <h3>Margins and padding</h3>
      <p>
        The page uses a max-width so lines don’t stretch too long across the screen. I also added
        padding inside the content “card” so the text doesn’t touch the edges. Extra spacing is added
        around headings, stage directions, and dialogue blocks so the reader can quickly follow who is speaking.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML abuse</h3>
      <p>
        I avoided using HTML elements just for appearance. I kept the play title as an <code>h1</code> because it is
        the highest-level heading on the page. I did not use <code>br</code> tags for spacing, and I relied on CSS for
        spacing and layout instead.
